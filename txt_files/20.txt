Cruel Summer
No amazing amount of depth to this one — it’s just pure cotton candy, with a little emotional fiber sprinkled around the edges. Her fandom is in near-universal agreement that this should have been a single to accompany her planned “LoverFest” tour of 2019, but that summer turned out to be crueler than anyone imagined, so it was a smash only in an alternate reality. The kind of Vocoder part in the call-and-response verses suggests this bop has an origin point somewhere in the ELO era, and of course it’s hard not to think of Banamarama, who were also cruelty-tested once upon a time. But this was all late-2010s in all its glory, before that glory got masked up.
